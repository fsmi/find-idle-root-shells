.SH NAME
.B find-idle-root-shells
\- detect unused root shells
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B find-idle-root-shells
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B find-idle-root-shells
is a helper script to detect unused root shells. It was created in the need
of a protection against bad admin habits, as some left their precious root
shells open for the public. This utility prints idle root shells on the
standard output, which triggers a mail when run from Cron.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no options. The idle time logic is hardcoded in the script. Changes
would be overriden on update.
